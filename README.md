# A mobile application called Dukkan 
This repository presents an example of shopping application taught by [Kodluyoruz](https://www.kodluyoruz.org/)

The app is implemented by using **react-native**. We use **Axios** to pull the information of products retrieved from [FakeStoreApi](https://fakestoreapi.com/). Furthuremore, we benefited from **Lottie** component to create loading and error animations.

We perform **react-navigation** in order to manage stack structure of the mobile app.
